# Workday Scheduler
<a href="https://zacfisher1990.github.io/workday_scheduler/" target="_blank">Web Page </a>

The purpose of this project is to create a workday scheduler for the user.
At the top of the page is the title. Underneath the title is the date, underneath the date is the current time showing hours, minutes, and seconds.
Below are the time blocks.
Each hour that has past is displayed with a gray background color.
The hour that is present is displayed with a red background color.
Future hours are displayed with a blue background color.
The user can type something below each hour and click "save" for that hour.
The entered text is saved to the browser's local storage and will display if the page is refreshed.
