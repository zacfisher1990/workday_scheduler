# Workday Scheduler <br>
<a href="https://zacfisher1990.github.io/workday_scheduler/" target="_blank">Web Page </a> <br>

The purpose of this project is to create a workday scheduler for the user. <br>
At the top of the page is the title. Underneath the title is the date, underneath the date is the current time showing hours, minutes, and seconds. <br>
Below are the time blocks. <br>
Each hour that has past is displayed with a gray background color. <br>
The hour that is present is displayed with a red background color. <br>
Future hours are displayed with a blue background color. <br>
The user can type something below each hour and click "save" for that hour. <br>
The entered text is saved to the browser's local storage and will display if the page is refreshed. <br>
